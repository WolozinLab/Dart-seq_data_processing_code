# Group definitions for BAM file merging
# Format: /path to bam file/XXX.bam
#
# Notes:
# - Each line defines a group with a name and a pattern/prefix for matching files
# - The pattern can contain wildcards (e.g., *DART-mut*.bam)
# - The prefix will match all files starting with that prefix

# Disease groups
DART-mut_AD	*DART-mut*AD*.bam
DART-mut_healthy	*DART-mut*healthy*.bam
